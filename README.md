# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

This project is using the Kickstarter dataset to visualize campaign outcomes based on their launch dates and their funding goals. This is part of Module 1 Challenge which is to be delivered by May 12, 2022. The challenge requires submission of the below work:

a)  Outcomes Based on Launch Date Chart

b)  Outcomes Based on Goals Chart

c) A written analysis of the results


### Purpose

To find out how different campaigns outcomes of the play fever in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals using Excel.

## Analysis and Challenges

* Using Excel to analyse & visulaize outcomes in the campaign based on Launch date & Goals.
* Data was processed by forming new columns like Years & new sheets Like Outcomes Based on Goals and using multiple formulaes to further forms Pivot Tables & Pivot Charts for visualising the outcomes.
* One of the error that produced an unexpected result was sorting the campaign outcomes in descending order. Crosschecking it with the desired table correction was made.
* The line chart named Theater_outcomes_vs_Launch.png shows theater outcomes plotted against the months of the year.
*  Another line chart named Outcome_vs_Goals.png shows relationship between goal-amount ranges on the x-axis and the percentage of successful,failed, or canceled projects on the y-axis.
*  A challenge was to sort the column of goals starting with value of less than 1000. After using Manual sorting this challenge was overcome.
